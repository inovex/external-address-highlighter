# External Address Highlighter

This is a web-extension.

It should work in Firefox and Chrome.  
Edge-support would be cool, but they do not support the promised-based APIs yet and can't be easily polyfilled. No port for now (see also #7).

Google will shut down Inbox at the end of March 2019 (see https://www.blog.google/products/gmail/inbox-signing-find-your-favorite-features-new-gmail/).
This extension will either vanish as well, or pivot (yeah, I said it) to Gmail.
